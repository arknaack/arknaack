- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @arknaack

- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning more about Python, R and SQL and finding interesting projects to do. 
I currently work in healthcare and also love sports, so those are the topics of most interest to me.

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™ve finished my MS in Business Analytics from the University of Iowa as well as my MBA. I am looking to continue to grow my programming skills outside of class.
I do not have much of an opportunity to use programming in my current job.
